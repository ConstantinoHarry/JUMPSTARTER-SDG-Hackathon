## 🌟 Project Overview

AIIGood is an innovative AI-powered mental wellness platform designed to provide 24/7 anonymous support for children, adults, and the elderly in Hong Kong. Our solution addresses the growing mental health crisis by combining cutting-edge AI technology with compassionate care, reducing stigma and improving access to mental health resources.

**Team**: AIIGood (Granville & Harry)  

## 🎯 The Problem

Hong Kong faces a significant mental health challenge:
- **3.4% prevalence** of mental health issues (>250,000 affected in 2020)
- **11% increase** in people seeking care (270,000 in 2019-20 → 300,000 in 2023-24)
- Persistent stigma, prejudices, and negative perceptions delay help-seeking behavior
- Insufficient support systems across all age groups
